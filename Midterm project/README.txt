Polynomial Operations Console Application
-----------------------------------------
This is a Python console application that allows users to perform arithmetic operations on polynomials, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and evaluation at specific values.


Project Structure

Requirements
------------
- Python 3.7+


Setup & Run
-----------
1. Download this folder and the files to your local machine.


2. Launch Jupyter Notebook in the project folder and open polynomial.ipynb.


3. Click ‘Run All Cells’ under ‘Run’ found in the menu bar at top.


4. Follow the prompts to enter polynomial terms (e.g., `3 x^2`, `-5 x`, `7`) and choose operations from a menu.


Testing
-------
1. Use the unittest module to unit test each of the methods as shown in test_polynomial.py


2. Convert Polynomial_Arithmetic_Calculator.ipynb to Polynomial_Arithmetic_Calculator.py.


3. Make sure all necessary files are in the same folder.


4. Run ‘python test_polynomial.py’ at the command line.
